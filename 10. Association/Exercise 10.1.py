#Write an Elevator class that receives the numbers of the bottom and top floors as initializer parameters.
# The elevator has methods go_to_floor, floor_up and floor_down.
# A new elevator is always at the bottom floor.
# If you make elevator h for example the method call h.go_to_floor(5), the method calls either the floor_up or floor_down methods as many times as it needs to get to the fifth floor.
# The methods run the elevator one floor up or down and tell what floor the elevator is after each move.
# Test the class by creating an elevator in the main program, tell it to move to a floor of your choice and then back to the bottom floor.
