# Familiarize yourself with the OpenWeather weather API at: https://openweathermap.org/api.
# Your task is to write a program that asks the user for the name of a municipality
# and then prints out the corresponding weather condition description text and temperature in Celsius degrees.
# Take a good look at the API documentation.
# Furthermore, find out how you can convert Kelvin degrees into Celsius.
